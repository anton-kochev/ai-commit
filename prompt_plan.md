# Development Blueprint for `ai-commit` CLI

**Objective:** Design and implement a Rust-based CLI tool `ai-commit` that generates Git commit messages from staged diffs using OpenAI's GPT-4. The tool will gather the diff of staged changes, filter out any ignored files, request a commit message via the ChatGPT API, and provide an interactive prompt for the user to accept, regenerate, or cancel the commit. This blueprint details the modular architecture, step-by-step implementation plan, and carefully crafted prompts to incrementally build the tool.

## High-Level Architecture

To manage complexity, the project is organized into clear modules, each handling a specific concern:

- **Git Module (`git`):** Uses the `git2` crate to interact with the Git repository. Responsible for retrieving the diff of staged changes (comparing the index against HEAD) and creating a commit with a given message. This encapsulates all Git operations (diff and commit) within one module.
- **Ignore Module (`ignore`):** Handles loading and matching ignore patterns (from `.gitignore` and related sources). Uses `globset` to compile ignore globs and provides functionality to filter out file paths that should be excluded from the diff (e.g., build artifacts or other ignored files).
- **OpenAI API Module (`api`):** Manages communication with the OpenAI ChatGPT API. Uses `reqwest` to make HTTP requests and `serde`/`serde_json` to serialize the request and deserialize the response. It constructs the prompt with the diff and retrieves the AI-generated commit message.
- **CLI Module (`cli`):** Manages user interaction in the terminal. Uses `dialoguer` to present the suggested commit message and prompt the user to confirm, regenerate, or cancel. This keeps user interface logic separate from business logic.
- **Logging:** The application initializes logging early (using the `log` crate with a simple logger like `env_logger`). Logging is used throughout the modules to record key events and errors, aiding debugging and transparency. By using the `log` facade, the implementation remains flexible (the actual logger can be swapped if needed).

**Crate Dependencies:** We will utilize several crates to fulfill these roles:
- `git2` for Git repository interactions (diff and commit operations).
- `globset` for pattern matching of ignore rules (similar to gitignore patterns).
- `dialoguer` for interactive CLI prompts (for user confirmation and selection).
- `reqwest` (with optional blocking feature) for HTTP requests to the OpenAI API.
- `serde` and `serde_json` for JSON serialization/deserialization of API requests and responses.
- `dotenv` (or `std::env`) for loading environment variables (like the OpenAI API key).
- `log` (with `env_logger`) for logging.

**Cross-Platform Considerations:** The design favors cross-platform compatibility:
- We use Rust's `git2` library instead of shelling out to the `git` command, ensuring the tool works uniformly on Windows, Linux, and macOS without relying on an external Git binary.
- File paths and patterns are handled with Rust’s `Path` and `globset`, abstracting away OS-specific path separators. (Git paths internally use forward slashes, and `globset` will handle these patterns; on Windows, we ensure to normalize paths when matching patterns so that ignore rules apply correctly.)
- Interactive prompts via `dialoguer` work on both Unix and Windows terminals. We avoid any non-portable TTY assumptions.
- If external commands are used (none planned in the final design), they would leverage `std::process::Command` with care for Windows quoting. In our case, all operations are done through crates, which should be inherently cross-platform.

**Logging Strategy:** From the start, we set up application-wide logging. Using the `log` crate’s macros (`info!`, `warn!`, `error!`, etc.) allows toggling verbosity via environment variables. We initialize a logger (like `env_logger`) in `main` so that all modules can log through the `log` facade without additional setup. This aids in debugging during development and provides users with feedback (for example, if the OpenAI API call fails, we can log the error).

## Implementation Plan Outline

The development will proceed in incremental, testable stages. Each stage will add a module or feature, ensuring we have a working baseline before moving to the next step:

1. **Project Setup and Logging:** Initialize a new Rust project. Set up the `Cargo.toml` with the basic dependencies (`log` and `env_logger`), and implement a simple `main.rs` that initializes logging and prints a start-up message. This confirms the project structure and logging are in place.
2. **Git Module – Retrieve Staged Diff:** Add the `git2` crate and create a `git` module. Implement functionality to open the repository in the current directory and extract the unified diff of staged changes (index vs HEAD). At this stage, simply output the diff (or a summary) to verify it works. This provides the core data (diff text) that will be sent to the AI.
3. **Ignore Module – Load Ignore Patterns:** Introduce the `globset` crate and create an `ignore` module. Implement reading of a `.gitignore` file (and possibly global gitignore patterns) from the repository, compile them into a `GlobSet`, and provide a function to check if a given path is ignored. Test this module by loading patterns and ensuring known ignored paths match (log the loaded patterns count or a sample match).
4. **Integrate Ignore Filtering into Diff:** Enhance the Git diff functionality to filter out ignored files using the `ignore` module. Before generating or while processing the diff, skip any changes to files that match the ignore patterns. This prevents sending irrelevant or large diffs (like those to ignored files) to the API. Verify that the filtered diff is correct (e.g., log which files are being filtered out).
5. **OpenAI API Module – Generate Commit Message:** Add `reqwest`, `serde`, and `serde_json` to the project. Create an `api` module with a function to call the OpenAI ChatGPT API (GPT-4 model) with the diff. It should construct a proper request (including model name, the diff in the prompt, etc.), send it with the API key from environment, and parse the response to extract the suggested commit message. For now, this function can be tested independently (e.g., by printing the result or handling errors). Ensure to handle cases like missing API key or network errors gracefully (return errors).
6. **Integrate API Call into Main Flow:** Connect the pieces in `main.rs`. After obtaining the filtered diff, use the `api` module to get a commit message suggestion. Log or print the suggested message to verify the end-to-end flow from diff to AI response is working. At this point, running the tool (with diffs staged and an API key set) should output an AI-generated commit message.
7. **CLI Module – Interactive Confirmation:** Add `dialoguer` to the project. Create a `cli` module to manage user interaction. Define an enum for user choices (e.g., Commit, Regenerate, Cancel) and a function that displays the suggested message and asks the user to confirm, regenerate a new message, or cancel. This uses `dialoguer::Select` (or similar) to present options. Integrate this interactive loop in `main`: if the user chooses to regenerate, call the API again for a new message and prompt again; if cancel, exit gracefully; if confirm, proceed to the final commit step.
8. **Git Commit Finalization:** Implement committing the changes with the chosen message. In the `git` module, add a function to create a new commit using `git2`: this writes the index to a tree, creates a commit with the current HEAD as parent (if available), and updates HEAD. Use `git2::Repository::signature` to get the user’s name/email and timestamp for the commit signature (which looks up Git config for user.name and user.email ([Repository in git2 - Rust](https://docs.rs/git2/latest/git2/struct.Repository.html#:~:text=Create%20a%20new%20action%20signature,default%20user%20and%20now%20timestamp))). Integrate this function in the flow after the user confirms. Upon success, print a success message (and maybe the commit SHA). If commit fails (e.g., no staged changes or config issues), log the error.
9. **Final Touches:** Review the code for any panics or unwraps and replace them with error handling that bubbles up or logs appropriately. Ensure all modules are connected, functions are used, and there are no dead code or unused variables. Test the complete flow: no staged changes scenario (should warn and exit), normal usage (should show suggestion and allow confirm/regenerate), and cancellation.

Each iteration adds functionality while keeping the application in a runnable state, minimizing big jumps in complexity. In the next sections, we break down these iterations into actionable coding steps. For each step, we provide a **prompt** (in a fenced code block) that a developer or code-generation AI can follow to implement the required feature. The prompts are written to build upon the previous steps, ensuring a coherent and integrated codebase by the end.

## Iterative Implementation Steps and Prompts

Below, each iteration is presented with a brief explanation and a code-generation prompt. The prompt is formatted as a Markdown fenced block with language `text`, which can be fed to an AI or followed by a developer to implement that stage. Each prompt focuses on a specific module or feature, and the modules interconnect to form the final working `ai-commit` tool.

### Iteration 1: Project Initialization & Logging

First, we set up the project structure and initialize logging. We will configure the `Cargo.toml` with initial dependencies and implement a basic `main.rs`. The main function will initialize the logger and print a startup message. This verifies that our environment is set up and logging works.

```text
You are building a Rust CLI tool called **ai-commit**. Begin by setting up the project with proper structure and logging:

1. **Cargo.toml**: Add the necessary dependencies for now:
   - `log = "0.4"` for logging macros (info, warn, etc.).
   - `env_logger = "0.9"` (or latest) to initialize a simple logger.
   - (We'll add more dependencies in later steps.)

2. **src/main.rs**:
   - Import the `log` crate macros and the `env_logger` initializer.
   - In `main()`, initialize the logger (use `env_logger::init()` to set up logging).
   - After initializing logging, print a startup message using the `info!` macro, e.g., "Starting ai-commit".
   - For now, if the tool is run without any specific action, just log an info message and exit. We'll expand this in later steps.

Make sure the program compiles and runs without errors or warnings. No actual functionality beyond logging is required in this step.
```

*(The above prompt guides the implementation of the initial project setup with logging. After this step, running `cargo run` should output an info log message indicating the tool has started.)*

### Iteration 2: Git Module – Retrieve Staged Diff

Next, we create the Git module to extract the diff of staged changes. Using the `git2` crate, we open the repository in the current directory and produce a unified diff (patch) of the differences between HEAD and the index (staged files). We’ll implement this in a new module `git` and test it by calling it from `main` and logging the diff length or content.

```text
Now, implement the **Git module** to retrieve the staged diff:

1. Add the `git2 = "0.16"` (or latest version) dependency to Cargo.toml.

2. Create a new file `src/git.rs` for the git module, and include it in `main.rs` with `mod git;`.
   - In `src/git.rs`, import the git2 crate (`use git2::Repository;` and other needed items).
   - Define a function `pub fn get_staged_diff() -> Result<String, git2::Error>` that:
     - Opens the current repository (use `Repository::open(".")?`).
     - Retrieves the HEAD tree (if HEAD exists: `repo.head()?` to get HEAD reference, then `head.peel_to_tree()?` for the tree; if HEAD is missing (no commits yet), you might use an empty tree by passing `None` in the diff).
     - Retrieves the index (`repo.index()?`).
     - Uses `repo.diff_tree_to_index(Some(&head_tree), Some(&index), None)?` to get a `Diff` of changes staged for commit (differences between HEAD and index).
     - Formats this diff as a unified diff string. Use `git2::DiffFormat::Patch` and iterate over diff hunks/lines to build the output:
       - Call `diff.print(DiffFormat::Patch, |delta, _hunk, line| { ... })` where the callback appends each line (`line.content()`) to a `String` buffer. Collect all diff text.
     - Return the diff text (the unified diff) as a `String`. If there are no staged changes, the diff might be empty string (handle that case if needed).
   - Include error handling: propagate git errors via the `Result`.

3. In `main.rs`, after the logging setup:
   - Call `git::get_staged_diff()`. If it returns an error, log the error (using `error!`) and exit.
   - If it returns successfully, log an info message with the diff content or a summary (for example, the length of the diff or first few lines) for verification.

Test this by staging some changes in a Git repo and running the tool. You should see the diff printed or logged. For now, it’s okay to log the raw diff to verify the output.
```

*(This prompt instructs how to implement the `git` module with a function to get the staged diff. It suggests using libgit2’s diff functions and collecting output via a callback. After this step, `ai-commit` should be able to fetch and display the staged diff when run in a Git repository with staged changes.)*

### Iteration 3: Ignore Module – Load Ignore Patterns

Now, we address ignoring certain files. We create an `ignore` module that reads ignore patterns (like those in `.gitignore`) and compiles them into a `GlobSet` for easy matching. The goal is to filter out any diff entries that correspond to ignored files (though typically ignored files wouldn’t be staged, this can also apply to deliberately excluding certain file patterns from AI analysis, e.g., large lockfiles). We’ll implement pattern loading in this step.

```text
Implement the **Ignore module** to handle gitignore patterns:

1. Add the `globset = "0.4"` crate to Cargo.toml for pattern matching.

2. Create a new file `src/ignore.rs`, and include it in `main.rs` with `mod ignore;`.

3. In `src/ignore.rs`:
   - Import `globset::{Glob, GlobSet, GlobSetBuilder}`.
   - Write a function `pub fn load_ignore_patterns(repo_path: &std::path::Path) -> Result<globset::GlobSet, Box<dyn std::error::Error>>` that:
     - Constructs a `GlobSetBuilder`.
     - Attempts to open a `.gitignore` file in the provided `repo_path` (the root of the repository). You can get the path by `repo_path.join(".gitignore")`.
     - If the file exists, read it line by line (use `std::fs::File` and `std::io::BufRead`).
       - For each line, trim whitespace and skip comments or empty lines.
       - For each valid pattern line, create a `Glob` with that pattern (use `Glob::new(pattern)?`) and add it to the builder.
       - (Ignore patterns beginning with '!' (negations) for simplicity, or handle them if you prefer. For now, we’ll focus on positive ignore patterns.)
     - Build the `GlobSet` from the builder (`builder.build()?`).
     - If the `.gitignore` file is not found, return an empty `GlobSet` (no patterns). **Important:** This is not an error; it just means no ignore rules, so initialize `GlobSetBuilder` and directly build an empty set.
     - Return the `GlobSet`.

   - Consider cross-platform path issues: `.gitignore` patterns use forward slashes. The `Glob` from globset will interpret patterns in Unix style by default. Ensure that when we match file paths, we use their relative path (from the repo root) with forward slashes. (Hint: we can get file paths from git diff as `Path`, and convert to a string for matching.)

4. (Optional for testing) In `main.rs`, after getting the diff (or before generating it in the future), call `ignore::load_ignore_patterns(std::env::current_dir()?.as_path())` to test loading. Log how many patterns were loaded or an example pattern, just to verify it's reading correctly. Then, you might not use the result yet – we’ll integrate it in the next step.

Make sure to handle errors: reading the file could fail if it doesn't exist (which should not be treated as fatal). Use `Box<dyn Error>` to capture different error types easily (I/O errors, glob errors, etc.). This step is mostly about preparing the ignore pattern matcher.
```

*(This prompt sets up the `ignore` module to parse a `.gitignore`. It ensures we consider comment lines and empty lines, and suggests ignoring advanced gitignore features for now. After this, the code can load ignore patterns and produce a `GlobSet`, though it’s not yet wired into the diff process.)*

### Iteration 4: Integrate Ignore Filtering into Diff Generation

With the ignore patterns ready, we integrate this into the diff generation. The `git::get_staged_diff` function will use the `ignore` module to exclude any diff hunks for files that match the ignore patterns. This ensures we don’t send irrelevant content to the AI. We modify the git module accordingly.

```text
Integrate ignore pattern filtering into the diff generation:

1. Update the `git::get_staged_diff` function in `src/git.rs`:
   - After opening the repository, but before generating the diff, load the ignore patterns:
     - Call `let repo_path = repo.workdir().unwrap_or_else(|| std::path::Path::new("."));`
       (This gets the working directory of the repo; use current dir if not available.)
     - Call `ignore::load_ignore_patterns(repo_path)?` to get a `GlobSet` of ignore patterns. If this function returns an error (e.g., invalid pattern), log a warning and proceed with an empty GlobSet rather than failing completely.
   - When printing/collecting the diff, skip over ignored files:
     - In the `diff.print(...)` callback, you receive a `DiffDelta` (`delta`) for each file. Use `delta.new_file().path()` (and possibly `delta.old_file().path()` for renames) to get the file path.
     - Convert the path to a relative string (for example, `if let Some(path) = delta.new_file().path() { let path_str = path.to_string_lossy(); ... }`).
     - Check `if ignore_set.matches(path_str.as_ref())` (or `ignore_set.is_match(Path)` if GlobSet supports Path directly) to determine if this file is ignored.
     - If the file path matches an ignore pattern, **skip** adding its diff lines to the output (essentially continue without appending to the diff string buffer for that file).
     - Otherwise, append the diff lines as normal.
   - This way, any file that should be ignored will produce no diff output.

2. Adjust return behavior:
   - If after filtering, the diff string is empty (meaning no staged changes or only ignored changes), consider returning an empty string (the calling code can decide how to handle that, possibly by informing the user that there's nothing to commit).
   - Ensure the function still returns `Result<String, git2::Error>` (we can still use git2::Error for git-related errors; ignore loading errors are handled separately or converted to a git2::Error using `?` with Box<dyn Error> will need a conversion or we change the return type to a generic Box<dyn Error> for simplicity across modules).
   - (If needed, change the return type to `Result<String, Box<dyn std::error::Error>>` to encompass both git2 and ignore errors easily.)

3. Update the call in `main.rs` accordingly:
   - When calling `git::get_staged_diff()`, adapt to any signature changes.
   - If the returned diff string is empty (and no error), log a message like "No diff to send (all changes ignored or none staged)" and exit or handle appropriately (for now, maybe treat it as no commit needed and exit).
   - Otherwise, proceed as before (for now, still just logging the diff or diff summary).

After this integration, test by staging a change to a file that is listed in .gitignore (or add a pattern for a file you stage). The diff output should exclude that file's changes. Verify that normal files still show up in the diff.
```

*(The prompt modifies the git module to filter out ignored files using the previously built GlobSet. It carefully describes how to skip adding diff lines for ignored file paths. After this step, the diff string returned should not contain any ignored file content. The code now gracefully handles ignore patterns.)*

### Iteration 5: OpenAI API Module – Generate Commit Message

Now we implement the integration with the OpenAI API to get a commit message suggestion. We create an `api` module that uses `reqwest` to call the ChatGPT API (GPT-4 model). This function will format the diff into a prompt, call the API, and return the suggested commit message. We ensure to handle environment variables for API keys and JSON parsing using `serde`.

```text
Implement the **OpenAI API module** to generate commit messages:

1. Add dependencies in Cargo.toml:
   - `reqwest = { version = "0.11", features = ["blocking", "json"] }` (using the blocking client for simplicity).
   - `serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }` and `serde_json = "1.0"` for JSON serialization/deserialization.
   - `dotenv = "0.15"` (or latest) to help load environment variables from a .env file (optional but useful).

2. Create a new file `src/api.rs`, and include it in `main.rs` with `mod api;`.

3. In `src/api.rs`:
   - Import `reqwest::blocking::Client`, `serde::{Deserialize, Serialize}`, and `serde_json`.
   - Define a function `pub fn generate_commit_message(diff: &str) -> Result<String, Box<dyn std::error::Error>>` that:
     - Loads the OpenAI API key:
       - Use `dotenv::dotenv().ok();` to load environment variables from a .env file, if present (so the user can put `OPENAI_API_KEY=<key>` in a .env file in the working directory).
       - Then get the API key from the env: `let api_key = std::env::var("OPENAI_API_KEY")?;`. If not set, return an error indicating the API key is missing.
     - Prepare the HTTP client: `let client = Client::new();`.
     - Construct the request body as JSON. For the ChatGPT API (GPT-4), the endpoint is `https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions`. The JSON should include:
       - `"model": "gpt-4"` (we use GPT-4 as specified).
       - `"messages": [...]` where we provide at least one user message with the diff. For example:
         ```json
         "messages": [
             {"role": "user", "content": "Generate a concise Git commit message describing the following changes:\n<diff content>"}
         ]
         ```
         Insert the `diff` text into this message content. (We might truncate or summarize the diff if it's extremely large to fit token limits, but for now assume diff is of reasonable size.)
       - Optionally, `"temperature": 0.7` or another value for creativity (or omit for default).
     - You can build this JSON using `serde_json::json!` macro or by defining a small `#[derive(Serialize)]` struct for the request payload.
     - Send the HTTP request:
       - Use `client.post("https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions")`.
       - Set the Authorization header with the API key: `.bearer_auth(&api_key)` (reqwest can use `bearer_auth` to add `Authorization: Bearer <token>`).
       - Set the Content-Type to application/json (reqwest's `json` method can serialize and set the header automatically if we pass a serde value).
       - Use `.json(&request_body)` if using serde_json value, or `.body(string)` with `.header("Content-Type", "application/json")` if you built the JSON as a string.
       - Call `.send()?` to execute the request and get a response.
     - Parse the response:
       - The API will return JSON. Define structs to capture the needed fields, e.g.:
         ```rust
         #[derive(Deserialize)]
         struct ChatChoice { message: ChatMessage }
         #[derive(Deserialize)]
         struct ChatMessage { role: String, content: String }
         #[derive(Deserialize)]
         struct ChatResponse { choices: Vec<ChatChoice> }
         ```
         This corresponds to the structure: the JSON has a "choices" array, where each choice has a "message" object with "role" and "content". We want the content of the assistant's message.
       - Use `let response_json: ChatResponse = res.json()?;` to parse.
       - Extract the commit message suggestion: `let commit_msg = response_json.choices.get(0).map(|c| c.message.content.clone()).unwrap_or_default();`.
         (Typically, there will be at least one choice; handle gracefully if not.)
     - Return the `commit_msg` (inside Ok). If any step fails (network error, JSON parse error, etc.), propagate the error using the `?` operator wrapped in our `Box<dyn Error>`.

   - Ensure to handle errors properly: missing API key (return an Err with a clear message), HTTP errors (reqwest errors implement Error), JSON parse errors, etc., all get propagated as Boxed Error.

4. In `main.rs`, after obtaining the filtered diff (from earlier steps):
   - If the diff is not empty, call `api::generate_commit_message(&diff)`.
   - If this returns an error (e.g., no API key or request failed), log the error (`error!("Failed to get commit message: {}", e)`) and exit (or return).
   - If it returns Ok(message), log or print the suggested commit message. For now, just output it to the console with an info or println, e.g., "AI suggested commit message: ...".

Test this step by running the tool with some staged changes and a valid `OPENAI_API_KEY` in env or .env. You should see a commit message suggestion printed out. (If actual API access is not available during development, you might temporarily mock this function to return a dummy message for testing the flow.)
```

*(This prompt sets up the `api` module and integrates an API call. It carefully covers constructing the request and parsing the response, using `serde` for type-safe JSON handling. After this step, the tool should be able to output an AI-generated commit message given some staged changes and an API key, albeit without user interaction yet.)*

### Iteration 6: CLI Module – Interactive Confirmation/Regeneration

With the commit message suggestion in hand, we build the interactive user interface. This involves showing the suggested message and asking the user whether to use it, regenerate a new one, or cancel. We'll use the `dialoguer` crate to present a simple menu. The logic will allow regenerating multiple times if the user chooses. We encapsulate this in a `cli` module for clarity.

```text
Add an interactive CLI confirmation step for using or regenerating the commit message:

1. Add `dialoguer = "0.10"` (latest) to Cargo.toml for interactive prompts.

2. Create a new file `src/cli.rs`, and include it in `main.rs` with `mod cli;`.

3. In `src/cli.rs`:
   - Import `dialoguer::{Select, Confirm}` (we'll use `Select` for a menu).
   - Define an enum to represent the user's action:
     ```rust
     pub enum UserChoice {
         Commit,
         Regenerate,
         Cancel,
     }
     ```
   - Implement a function `pub fn prompt_user_for_action(suggested_message: &str) -> UserChoice` that:
     - Displays the suggested commit message to the user. For example, print it out to the console in quotes or with formatting:
       ```rust
       println!("\nSuggested commit message:\n\"{}\"\n", suggested_message);
       ```
       (Ensure a clear separation, maybe with newlines, so the user can see the message distinctly.)
     - Presents a prompt for the user to choose an action. Use `Select`:
       - Create a `Select::new()` and item list: e.g., `["✅ Use this message", "🔄 Regenerate message", "❌ Cancel"]` (check marks and X are optional for clarity).
       - You can use `.default(0)` to pre-select the first option (Use this message).
       - Call `.interact()?` to let the user select an option (this returns the index).
     - Match the selected index and return the corresponding `UserChoice` variant:
       - 0 -> `UserChoice::Commit`
       - 1 -> `UserChoice::Regenerate`
       - 2 -> `UserChoice::Cancel`
     - If the user aborts (EOF or Ctrl+C), also return `Cancel` as a safe default.
     - This function may return a `Result<UserChoice, std::io::Error>` if needed (because `interact()` can error), but you can handle errors inside (e.g., treat error as cancel or retry). Simplicity: you can unwrap the `interact()` for now or expect it, assuming a valid TTY.

4. Now integrate this in `main.rs`:
   - Remove the direct printing of the suggested message from last step. Instead, after getting `suggested_message` from `api::generate_commit_message` (and ensuring it's Ok):
     - Enter a loop that will allow regenerating:
       ```rust
       let mut commit_msg = suggested_message;
       loop {
           let choice = cli::prompt_user_for_action(&commit_msg);
           match choice {
               UserChoice::Commit => {
                   // User accepted the message
                   break;
               }
               UserChoice::Regenerate => {
                   // Call the API again to get a new message
                   info!("User chose to regenerate the commit message");
                   match api::generate_commit_message(&diff) {
                       Ok(new_msg) => {
                           commit_msg = new_msg;
                           continue; // loop again with the new suggestion
                       }
                       Err(e) => {
                           error!("Failed to regenerate commit message: {}", e);
                           // On API failure, ask again or break? Here, break and abort commit.
                           return Err(e.into());
                       }
                   }
               }
               UserChoice::Cancel => {
                   info!("User canceled the commit");
                   // Exit the program without committing
                   std::process::exit(0);
               }
           }
       }
       ```
     - After this loop, if it breaks on `Commit`, we have the final `commit_msg` that the user accepted.

   - Make sure to bring `cli::UserChoice` into scope or reference it fully.

5. For now, after breaking out (user accepted), just log that we would commit:
   `info!("Committing with message: {}", commit_msg);`
   (We will implement the actual commit in the next step.)

6. Error handling: ensure any errors from `prompt_user_for_action` (like I/O) or regenerate are handled. In this design, we treat them as cancellation or propagate as needed.

Test the interactive flow:
   - Run the tool, ensure it shows the suggested message and options.
   - Try selecting each option: "Use this message" should break out of loop (though commit not yet done), "Regenerate" should fetch a new suggestion (you can verify a new API call is made), "Cancel" should exit the program.
   - If using a real API, you'll see possibly different suggestions on regeneration. If API fails or rate-limits, ensure the error is handled (our code logs error and exits in that case).
```

*(This prompt introduces the `cli` module and outlines how to prompt the user for actions using `dialoguer`. The main loop is described to allow multiple regenerations. After this step, the tool provides an interactive experience: the user sees the AI commit message and can accept or request another. The commit isn’t performed yet, which is added next.)*

### Iteration 7: Finalizing Commit with Git2

The last major step is to create an actual Git commit with the message the user accepted. We extend the `git` module with a commit function. This function will write the staged changes as a new commit (using libgit2). We then integrate this at the end of our main flow. At this point, `ai-commit` will complete its primary loop and perform the commit if the user confirmed.

```text
Finalize the commit operation using the Git module:

1. In `src/git.rs`, implement a function to create a commit:
   ```rust
   pub fn commit_with_message(message: &str) -> Result<(), git2::Error> {
       let repo = Repository::open(".")?;
       // Ensure there is something to commit:
       let mut index = repo.index()?;
       if index.is_empty() {
           return Err(git2::Error::from_str("No staged changes to commit"));
       }
       // Write the index to a tree:
       let tree_oid = index.write_tree()?;
       let tree = repo.find_tree(tree_oid)?;
       // Get current HEAD commit (if exists) to use as parent:
       let parents = if let Ok(head_ref) = repo.head() {
           if head_ref.is_valid() {
               // Peel the HEAD reference to commit
               let head_commit = head_ref.peel_to_commit()?;
               vec![&head_commit]
           } else {
               Vec::new()
           }
       } else {
           Vec::new()  // no HEAD (repository might have no commits yet)
       };
       // Create commit signature (user name, email, current time) from git config:
       let signature = repo.signature()?;  // this fetches user.name & user.email from confi ([Repository in git2 - Rust](https://docs.rs/git2/latest/git2/struct.Repository.html#:~:text=Create%20a%20new%20action%20signature,default%20user%20and%20now%20timestamp))】
       // Perform the commit:
       repo.commit(
           Some("HEAD"),      // point HEAD to the new commit
           &signature,        // author
           &signature,        // committer (same as author here)
           message,           // commit message
           &tree,
           &parents.iter().collect::<Vec<_>>()[..]  // convert Vec<&Commit> to slice
       )?;
       Ok(())
   }
   ```

   - The above creates a new commit on HEAD with the given message. It handles the case of an initial commit (no parents) by using an empty parent list.
   - We use `repo.signature()` to automatically get the user's name/email and current timestam ([Repository in git2 - Rust](https://docs.rs/git2/latest/git2/struct.Repository.html#:~:text=Create%20a%20new%20action%20signature,default%20user%20and%20now%20timestamp))】. Ensure that the user has set `user.name` and `user.email` in their Git config; otherwise, `repo.signature()` may return an error which will propagate.
   - We check if index is empty to avoid committing nothing (return an error in that case).
   - Note: We gather parents into a slice of `&Commit`. If there's one parent (normal case), we pass that; if none (first commit), we pass an empty slice.

   Handle errors accordingly (propagate them to the caller).

1. In `main.rs`, after the user has confirmed the commit message (the loop from previous step is broken with a chosen `commit_msg`):
   - Call `if let Err(e) = git::commit_with_message(&commit_msg) { error!("Failed to commit: {}", e); std::process::exit(1); }`.
   - If it returns Ok, the commit was successful. Log an info or print a success message to the user, e.g., `info!("Commit created successfully.")` and maybe output the commit message or SHA (the commit function currently returns nothing, but we could modify it to return the new commit Oid if needed).
   - After a successful commit, the program can exit normally (0 status).

1. Clean up any loose ends:
   - Make sure all temporary logs (like printing the diff contents in earlier steps) are removed or toned down, so the final output focus is on the interactive prompt and results.
   - Perhaps print a neat summary at the end: e.g., "✔ Commit applied.".
   - Ensure error cases (no staged changes, git not a repository, no API key, etc.) all result in user-friendly messages (logged or printed) and appropriate exit codes.

Test the entire flow in a real Git repository:
   - Scenario 1: No staged changes -> The tool should detect and inform the user, then exit without error (or with a specific message).
   - Scenario 2: Staged changes, API key set -> The tool suggests a commit message, user accepts -> The changes should be committed with that message (verify `git log` afterwards).
   - Scenario 3: User chooses regenerate -> The tool fetches a new suggestion (maybe simulate by intentionally choosing regenerate to see that it indeed changes or calls API again).
   - Scenario 4: User cancels -> No commit is made, and the program exits gracefully.
   - Also test error paths: e.g., no API key -> should log an error about missing API key; API call failure -> should log error and exit; Git commit failure (e.g., no user.name config) -> should log error from libgit2.

By now, the `ai-commit` CLI tool is feature-complete: it fetches staged diffs, filters ignores, uses AI to propose a message, and handles user interaction and committing.
```

*(This final prompt guides implementing the commit functionality and integrating it, completing the development of `ai-commit`. It references how `repo.signature()` uses Git config for user identit ([Repository in git2 - Rust](https://docs.rs/git2/latest/git2/struct.Repository.html#:~:text=Create%20a%20new%20action%20signature,default%20user%20and%20now%20timestamp))】. After this iteration, the tool should perform actual commits with the AI-generated message if the user confirms.)*

## Conclusion and Next Steps

The above blueprint lays out a structured approach to building `ai-commit` incrementally. By following the step-by-step prompts, we create a robust CLI with distinct modules for Git operations, ignore handling, OpenAI API interaction, and user interface. Each iteration produces a working intermediate version, adding one feature at a time and minimizing integration pain.

**Future enhancements:** After the core functionality is verified, we might consider additional improvements such as:
- Configurable commit styles (e.g., conventional commit prefixes or template).
- Caching or rate-limiting API usage, or combining multiple file diffs into one prompt more intelligently.
- Enhanced ignore handling (respecting global gitignore or negation rules, using the `ignore` crate for full gitignore spec compliance).
- Making the OpenAI model or temperature configurable via CLI flags.
- More robust error messaging and perhaps fallback to a simpler behavior if the API is unavailable (like echoing diff or aborting commit).

With the current design, these enhancements can be added in their respective modules (e.g., extending the `api` module for different models or the `cli` module for additional prompts). The modular architecture ensures that each concern is isolated, making maintenance and extension easier.

By adhering to the outlined plan, a developer (or an AI code assistant) can implement `ai-commit` as a fully functional tool that improves the Git commit workflow by leveraging AI for commit message generation, all while maintaining control in the hands of the developer through an interactive confirmation step.
